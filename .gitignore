# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
bundler_stubs/

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# keep the database.yml document out of the repo
# some say you should include this, but heroku doesn't
# use it, and i can upload it directly to bluehost when
# needed. i'd much rather keep it out of repo so i can
# have a public repo.
